# World of Goo Milestone II Start Code

A simple simulation framework using libigl and cmake. Based on Alec Jacobson's libigl example project. This project contains some boilerplate that sets up a physical simulation to run in its own thread, with rendering provided by libigl, as well as a partial implementation of Milestone I with the features relevant to Milestone II.

## Compile

Compile this project using the standard cmake routine:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

This should find and build the dependencies and create a `example_bin` binary.

## Run

From within the `build` directory just issue:

    ./goo_bin

A glfw app should launch displaying the goo world and GUI.

## Dependencies

The only dependencies are stl, eigen, [libigl](libigl.github.io/libigl/) and
the dependencies of the `igl::viewer::Viewer` (mandatory: glfw and
opengl, optional: nanogui and nanovg).

We recommend you to install libigl using git via:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/libigl/libigl.git
